v01 - Only Rayleigh fading, no shadowing, no path loss, one base station - only UE interference.

v02 - Has pathloss, shadowing, and Rayleigh fading. No intercell interference being dealt with. We see increased performance from independent shadowing assumed by antennae being separated.

v03 - has pl, shadow, rayleigh fading. no intercell interference. Has distributed MIMO with respect to a radius around the centre (no rx in the centre of the circle). Equal power allocation towards each antenna. We consider uplink conenction.
